# State

> Live dashboard of where the project is. Updated by the team-lead at every phase transition, feature completion, and release.

> **Durable work state lives in the tracker, not here.** Majors, milestones (the roadmap), and features are cairn artifacts under [`process/cairn/`](cairn/) — view them on the board (`/cairn`, `http://localhost:8766/`) or list them with `scripts/cairn/cairn ls`. This file keeps only what the tracker deliberately doesn't model: the current phase, the active feature pointer, and shipped releases. **No history accumulates here** — this file is auto-injected into every session, so it holds only current state; work history lives in the tracker (issue comments), the git log, and the PRs.

## Current Phase

**Phase:** Implement — milestone `POLY-M1` Foundations (L0 platform, L1 identity & tenancy, L6 app shell; `process/cairn/milestones/POLY-M1.md`). Plan gate approved 2026-11-09 (POLY-127): ARCH v1.11, SECURITY v1.4, INFRA v1.2 and DESIGN v0.17 were approved at the gate; ARCH is now v1.13 (layer map and its enforcement; Drizzle Kit confirmed by the POLY-76 spike, §6.2) and SECURITY v1.5.1, both 2026-11-09. `POLY-C` closed and archived. POLY-76 is done; the rest of the first session's issues are in `todo` (POLY-82, 83, 84, 85); the throwaway prototype at `prototype/` is the look-and-feel reference until the first real screens ship.  
**Started:** 2026-11-09  
**Driver agent:** backend-lead (qa-engineer drives Validate)  
**Gate criteria:** _see [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md)_

## Active Feature

A feature = one cairn issue = one PR = one Implement→Validate loop. Exists only during Implement phase. This is a pointer — the issue file (`process/cairn/issues/<ID>.md`) is the record.

_None. POLY-76 (migration spike) merged 2026-11-09 via PR #98: Drizzle Kit confirmed._

- **Next:** `/start-feature POLY-82` (monorepo skeleton + layer lint), then POLY-83 → POLY-84, POLY-85.
- **Before POLY-82 starts:** a doc update carries the spike's findings into POLY-82, POLY-84 and POLY-87, ARCH §3.1 (sign-up inside our own transaction, Principal 2026-11-09), SECURITY and INFRA. The list is in `process/cairn/reviews/POLY-76/ruling.md` §4, §6 and §7.

## Releases

**Template base:** bootstrapped 2026-09-23 from [`project_template`](https://github.com/richmosko/project_template) **v0.12.2** — diff template updates against that tag when porting them here.

Full history, every tagged release with its notes, lives at [the GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/richmosko/polycarpic/releases) — this row is a pointer, not a log. Cut via `/merge-pr`; `/merge-pr` **replaces** this row (never appends) on every tag.

| Version | Date | Major line | Milestone shipped | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | POLY-V1 | none yet | main | No release cut |

## Decisions

The Decision Log lives alongside this file at [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) (under `process/`) — split out so this file stays compact for auto-loading. Append new entries there; conventions are documented in [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md) → Decision logging.
