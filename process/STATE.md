# State

> Live dashboard of where the project is. Updated by the team-lead at every phase transition, feature completion, and release.

> **Durable work state lives in the tracker, not here.** Majors, milestones (the roadmap), and features are cairn artifacts under [`process/cairn/`](cairn/) — view them on the board (`/cairn`, `http://localhost:8766/`) or list them with `scripts/cairn/cairn ls`. This file keeps only what the tracker deliberately doesn't model: the current phase, the active feature pointer, and shipped releases. **No history accumulates here** — this file is auto-injected into every session, so it holds only current state; work history lives in the tracker (issue comments), the git log, and the PRs.

## Current Phase

**Phase:** Implement — milestone `POLY-M1` Foundations (L0 platform, L1 identity & tenancy, L6 app shell; `process/cairn/milestones/POLY-M1.md`). Plan gate approved 2026-11-09 (POLY-127): ARCH v1.11, SECURITY v1.4, INFRA v1.2 and DESIGN v0.17 were approved at the gate; ARCH is now v1.15.16 (layer map and its enforcement; Drizzle Kit confirmed by the POLY-76 spike, §6.2; sign-up inside our own transaction, §3.1), SECURITY v1.9.12 and INFRA v1.3.8. `POLY-C` closed and archived. The first session's issues (POLY-76, 82, 83, 84, 85) are done; the throwaway prototype at `prototype/` is the look-and-feel reference until the first real screens ship.  
**Started:** 2026-11-09  
**Driver agent:** backend-lead (qa-engineer drives Validate)  
**Gate criteria:** _see [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md)_

## Active Feature

A feature = one cairn issue = one PR = one Implement→Validate loop. Exists only during Implement phase. This is a pointer — the issue file (`process/cairn/issues/<ID>.md`) is the record.

- **Feature:** Invite-only sign-up
- **Issue:** POLY-87 (cairn)
- **Milestone:** POLY-M1
- **Branch:** `feature/poly-87-invite-only-sign-up`
- **Started:** 2026-11-12
- **Goal:** after the first operator user, an invitation is the only way into an instance, and sign-up commits the user, their Person, membership and accounts together.
- **Status:** In Progress

Standing constraints: no better-auth or passkey pin change merges before the S9 test in POLY-137 exists; the `db` job's budget is 100 s and only warns (86 s median), so a loop that pushes the median past it brings its own cut; Caddy must overwrite `X-Forwarded-For` (POLY-138) before the first deploy, or every sign-in answers 503. A package is left only by its `@poly/<name>` import (lint-enforced). Nothing is deployed; second-factor enrolment stays closed until POLY-89.

- **Next:** POLY-97 (infra scaffolding; needs a real Hetzner project) alongside. POLY-131 held (P3).

## Releases

**Template base:** bootstrapped 2026-09-23 from [`project_template`](https://github.com/richmosko/project_template) **v0.12.2** — diff template updates against that tag when porting them here.

Full history, every tagged release with its notes, lives at [the GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/richmosko/polycarpic/releases) — this row is a pointer, not a log. Cut via `/merge-pr`; `/merge-pr` **replaces** this row (never appends) on every tag.

| Version | Date | Major line | Milestone shipped | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | POLY-V1 | none yet | main | No release cut |

## Decisions

The Decision Log lives alongside this file at [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) (under `process/`) — split out so this file stays compact for auto-loading. Append new entries there; conventions are documented in [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md) → Decision logging.
